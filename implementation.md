# Implementation
## Completed By Max Mander

## Introduction
The dataset used for this system is vast. It has a total number of entries amounting to 4,143 as of 6/29/2024. Each entry in this data set shares a lot of valuable information for each accident such as the date, time, severity, and location (coordinates) of each collision. However, there is one issue with this dataset which is that there information regarding the location of each collision is only coordinates. This makes it more complex to implement a search feature allowing the user to find collisions in a set location rather than by specific coordinates. Each entry found in this dataset was reported to the police who then shared the information regarding the collision with the council. Also, this dataset excludes any collisions that do not involve personal injury.

# index.hmtl:
The role of index.html in this project is to provide the user with a simple introduction to the system. It has a small amount of text explaining what the application does. It also lets the user decide whether they want to view the data as a table or as a map.


# map.html:
The role of map.html in this project is to gather the data from open data Bristol and plot each entry on a map. It also asks the user for their current location which is also then plotted on the map. Each marker plotted on the map can be clicked which provides the user with the information regarding each collision such as date, time, severity, vehicles, casualties, and pedestrians.

# table.hmtl:
The role of table.html in this project is to gather the data from open data Bristol and plot each entry on a table. It also allows the user to sort the table by the date, severity, and number of casualties. As well as being able to sort the table, the user can also filter the table depending on the severity of the collision (Servere, Moderate, and Minor).

# User guide

## Use Case 1: View accident hot-spots

The user accesses the website and selects the option to view the data via map
![](images/UC1.1.png)

The Map displays the collisions and the user can easily see which areas have the most collisions
![](images/UC1.2.png)

The user can then share their location with the application which is then plotted on the map
![](images/UC1.3.png)

## Use Case 2: View Detailed Crash Reports
The user Accesses the website and selects the option to view the data via table
![](images/UC2.1.png)

The table containing the collision information is displayed to the user
![](images/UC2.2.png)

The user can then filter the table by severity
![](images/UC2.3.png)

## Use Case 3: Filter by Severity
The user Accesses the website and selects the option to view the data via table
![](images/UC2.1.png)

The user can then filter the table by severe collisions
![](images/UC3.1.png)

The user can then filter the table by Moderate collisions
![](images/UC2.3.png)

The user can then filter the table by Minor collisions
![](images/UC3.2.png)
