# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
The problem to be addressed in within this project is to reduce the frequency and severity of road collisions.
This will be achieved by using a data set from open data Bristol to map out recent car accidents. 
This should result in a map that shows the areas of Bristol where the most car collisions have happened in
recent times which may lead to people taking different routes when travelling. This could lead to a reduced number of collisions on Bristol's roads.

### Business benefits
- Reduction in road accidents
- Full access to this mapped data could be sold at a price to other companies (could include specifics in relation to the each accident)
- The data could be used by city planners in future road developments to create more optimal road designs to reduce collisions
- Partnership possibilities with GPS providers - show the user the safest route based on the likelihood of a road accident

### Options Considered
There are current websites that do already map road accidents. One example of an existing website is CrashMap.co.uk.
As CrashMap provides data for the entire UK, their premium pricing for full access is very steep coming in at Â£1175 
per year for just one user. Where as companies only operating in Bristol would not be interested in road collisions 
happening hundreds of miles away as it does not directly impact their business. These business located in Bristol
would be more inclined to pay a smaller fee for data that is more tailored for their needs

### Expected Risks
One risk would be to ensure that the data is updated and accurate as not having up to date data or accurate
data would result in the website being a failure. Another risk would be gaining traction with the target 
audience (Bristol residents and Bristol business owners) as they may already being using another service for this need.
