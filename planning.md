# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
This app will be used to map out vehicle accidents in Bristol. There is already an app that does this (crashmap.co.uk),
but they charge a premium if users want to access this information in more depth for the entirety of the UK. As this data is for the UK, alot of users
will be paying extra for data that they will not use. This is where this app will be useful as users will not have to pay to have access to the data for Bristol.

### Business benefits
- Reduction in road accidents
- The data could be used by city planners in future road developments to create more optimal road designs to reduce collisions
- Partnership possibilities with GPS providers - show the user the safest route based on the likelihood of a road accident

### Options Considered
There are current websites that do already map road accidents. One example of an existing website is CrashMap.co.uk.
As CrashMap provides data for the entire UK, their premium pricing for full access is very steep coming in at Â£1175 
per year for just one user. Where as companies only operating in Bristol would not be interested in road collisions 
happening hundreds of miles away as it does not directly impact their business. These business located in Bristol
would be more inclined to use a free service that gives them a similar result but for free.

### Expected Risks
One risk would be to ensure that the data is updated and accurate as not having up to date data or accurate
data would result in the website being a failure. Another risk would be gaining traction with the target 
audience (Bristol residents and Bristol business owners) as they may already being using another service for this need.
